This is a University project using the Acme Framework to create a WIS, to assist airports in
managing logistics for charter flights. This includes flight scheduling, booking management,
crew management, incident reporting and resolution, as well as aircraft maintenance.

It is based on a starter project, intended to be a core learning asset for the students
who have enrolled the Design and Testing subject of the Software Engineering curriculum of the
University of Seville. This project helps them start working on their new information system
projects.

To get this project up and running, please follow the guideline in the theory/lab materials,
taking into account that you must link the appropriate version of the Acme-Framework excluding
the following resources:
